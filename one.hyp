i do volunteer work as a member of the pegone mobile go medical unit what we do is we go out we set up with the tent and a cooler of water and provide free drinks sunscreen bug spray and stuff to people who are out playing the game that way we can keep people safe keep people hydrated normally we have a um first aid kit with us as wellbut every day when i’m out there i’m interacting even though i’m interacting as a character in a game with the people i’m interacting with them trying to solicit donations and stuff to keep the unit going and to donate to our local organization i personally work with shoots for kids when i set up the boothbut while i’m working and i m trying to help them stay hydrated help them with the game and everything i’m also trying to solicit those donations because not only are we trying to stay afloat and stay active for them were also trying to give back to the community through the sheets for kids programum one specific time i have cause plays nurse joy which is one of the medical units and while i was bandaging a child’s knee i was having to explain exactly who we are and stuff to parents while telling them oh anything beyond what we get goes to sheets for kids but it does help us stay afloat by purchasing water the band aides and the sunscreenmostly i just do it by having a smile on my face and being honest with people because if youre a good charitable
i’d like to approach this question from a perspective of a past jobi used to work at fast food at a wendy’s restaurant actually and i was a one of the closers i spent most of my time after the dinner rush in the kitchen cleaning upand which meant that i didn’t spend a lot time out front at that time but there would be a couple usually two or three sometimes four depending on the if it was a busy day people you know handling the rest of the customers for the night the drive through the dining room things like thatthere was one pair of people in particular that were thereone of them was the manager lisa she was a shift manager she was not the store manager and another one was a cashier a young girl was 15 at the time i believe her name was robinthose two didn’t get along very well at alli’m not sure exactly the issues were between them but they were both fairly young and again at the time so was i and they just clashed i wasn’t sure if it was personality or they had had some disagreement at some time they argued all the timemy primary action taken during those situations was to stay out of the way and stay in the kitchen and do my job and let them worry about the resthowever there were a few times where it really came to a head and i actually had to step up to them and say you know what we are here for a reason we are getting paid to do a job and whatever your feelings are about each other you really need to set them asidenow i don’t know what they thought about that but it did tend to have a calming effect on their relationship at least on the times that i did it so i counted it as a win 
so i was taking i worked for a company that sold pre painted parts for cars and i was taking thousands of listings that were on ebay and they needed to be put onto amazon and the download segment didn’t work between the two sites so what had to be done was each individual part had to be put into a spreadsheet with price and item number and information and then sent over to amazon and so this had to be done 50 000 times it was incredibly tedious and boring and there were just a few of us that were doing it and i just had to take a lot of breaksi would work for half an hour and then i would go spend 10 minutes doing something else for work as wellbut just something to break up the monotony of doing the same thing over and over and over again i also made games in my mind like little incentiveswhen i got to this number i got to go get a coffee or just something to break up the monotony because doing the same thing over and over again and this lasted for weeks of doing this was mind numbing and it was easy to zone out and make mistakes  and so i find that if i anything if just break tasks up into smaller tasks and assign some sort of an incentive for getting to that and doing it correctly and some of the time it would be the girls that i would you know go shopping at the end of the day if we hit a certain benchmark so i just did that for myself and i did it for my employees as well that was just set certain goals and if we hit them we earned rewards
this goes back to when i was in school and a member of the group who were one of my upper division classes i meant was to build a design for a machine that everyone could agree on it had to meet certain criteria and we were in a group of sixeverybody pretty much had their own ideas about how to go about itnobody wanted to negotiate because everybody thought their idea was the best we ended up choosing three designs to look at more closely my design was one of thoseas a result i tried to build up my case the best way i could i designed a powerpoint presentation with some basic math models of how the machinery itself would fit together i did some solid works basically modeling to show how the components looked how the ultimate machine looked and i did my best to highlight the key aspects of the machine how it would work how everything would fit together well i probably spend about three hours of my own time outside of school putting everything together to get my own point across and when we had our meeting we each presented i actually presented longer than everyone else because i put more thought and effort into it  i had the basic models already done i had powerpoint presentation done and i had even done some basic calculations to make sure that my model was even feasible for the design ultimately after we had our meeting everyone was pretty impressed with the work i had put into it and we ended up choosing my design which was great because after i had done the preliminary studies we actually went a lot more in depth with it but what i had started ended up being great for what we ended up doing
again this situation would have occurred at the umm college of where i was a financial aid assistant trying to explain to the students and to their parents how to fill the financial documents out and what each line item meant and a lot of times i would use examples of somebody else’s documents or make up mock completed applications make up mock erroneous applications and let them see this let them compare the two ask them bring in their tax returns and let me show them exactly uh the corresponding umm line item numbers i used a lot of analogies anything that would say um to them this is real money even though you don’t get the cash in your hand you’re getting money such as the earned income credit  a lot of people did not understand that response that particular answer at all i just took time patience um to just go over it with each individual person and many times in a whole group and answered the questions as best i could and if i saw there was a pattern to the questions i came up with a complete portion of my explanation to address that patternit let me know what they needed explained better than what i was doing and so i would take from that example from that session and come back and come up with a better explanation and better way of teaching them that and i think i was quite successfulwe had a lot of success
hi whelp take me back it’s probably not a do a good project with robert his classmate from my network class no one really liked him i mean not having anything personally against him he just he kind of was like a rule mungler we like to say he would like oh you look exactly like this and it would take so much longer yeah i ended up pretty much doing almost all the task by myself thats how group project end a lot of the time i think i mean wasn’t end of world but it wasn’t good experience either just basically was eh i don’t know i just did the project myself basically ian was like here yeah don’t work me again i’m sure i mean we weren’t violent towards each other but it was still was like eh yeah i do wish that i don’t know maybe he would be more willing to like be more realistic because worth itthis is just always how group project are i’m guessing i should wait for the timer to run out 
so this one was pretty recent one of my subordinates call him smith in this case he tends to be misconstrued as having attitude when in reality he’s just overly confidentso we he was standing post at a guard post we’ll just call it that control point so people come in and out he was standing there and recently there had been a lot of dog and pony show kind of rules here things like keep your work area clear of water bottles no drinks no food stay standing at all times if you’re on post because sitting down just looks unprofessional things like that the water bottle rule specifically the drink rule that applied to different area but not to his post because of the link how long he would be standing there and the fact that it was next to an open door so you can get dehydrated very easilyhe knew that and then one of the other supervisors we will call them staff sergeants he did not know thatso this staff sergeant we will call him jamesjames came by and starting telling him that he needed to remove that and that was an order from co etc  etc smith who knew the orders who had the the binder with the orders with him told him that was not the case and it became kind of an argumentand eventually i had to come and diffuse the situation because he was trying to verbally abuse smith and essentially say that he was disrespecting his rank as a staff sergeant supervisor and a subordinate shouldn’t be doing thati had to let him know that when you are wrong it doesn’t matter what rank you are what position you hold in an organization if you’re wrong you are still wrong it doesn’t matter if the new guy is telling you that
this situation took place very shortly after our move to a new facilityi currently hold the position of liaison of information technology within the hospital i manage all the computers and monitors and television equipment within the facility however this being a veterinary hospital we do see a good number of patients dogs cats horses cows exotic animals that type of thing i also happen to be a registered veterinary technician and during this one situation there was a shortage of nursing staff of the registered vet techs on the floor and we needed there were patients that needed to be treated there were patients that needed to have blood drawn and treatments done so using my my training as a registered vet tech i stepped in to help restrain and help take blood and i had to gain the trust of the doctors who did not know me as well as some of the other doctors in the facility i had to gain their trust and make sure that they understood that i do know how to do these skills i do know how to perform treatments how to restrain how to how to collect blood samples and whatnot so i basically spent twenty to thirty minutes just going through and demonstrating with them firsthand exactly how these skills are to be performed before they were basically just willing to accept my help and once they accepted that the outcome was very very positiveeverything got done everyone got treated and everything came off without a hitch
so now there is a little bit more time to tell you about a time when a member of the group two members of the group did not work well togetherlike i said in my current group i pass i’m manager i mean she would give us you know she would give us instructions on duties how to do x y z x y zso well do it and then we’ll come back so we were talking about members of the group its not even members its members and the manager so she’s part of the group we would come back and say well you chose to do it like this  shed mark it up and say no that’s not what i told you to do so we’ve had to literally start right now what was being said and at that point even that didn’t make a differenceso how did i handle the situation i really had to stop runningi had to really just put my faith and trust in god and say you know what i gotta do the best i can do for me because i only i know and he know that my motives as long as you know that your motives are in the right place and as long you’re not doing out of malice you can you you will win in this situationum was the jappay  sp   how was the current now  sp  it was a point in time where i was stressed when the whole group was stressedi mean we’ve had people who’ve had to branch out and go to get additional assistance you know for their own stuff to make sure they wasn’t losing their mind really we’ve had people who have left the group because you just you just couldn’t get in cohesiveness as to okay what am i doing wrong how am i doing wrong why am i doing it wrong and whys it wrong this time when it wasn’t wrong two weeks agowhy is it wrong this time when it wasn’t wrong you know the other day it’s just you have to find a balance within yourself and you gotta be you gotta know what you’re doing so when you’re when you do get questioned you can say you know what it’s not methis is just not me
well as far as unpleasant tasks go i would have to say that’s usually just part of any job unless that you work for yourself and even then there are unpleasant tasks in my very first dish washing job when i worked at a big fast paced restaurant i usually got the short end of the stick i can say that i probably got more unpleasant tasks than anybody and um i didn’t really try to argue or become defensive about it i would normally just you know chuckle a little bit and then get one with the task some of the tasks ranged from cleaning frozen ice off of the pipes in the downstairs meat cooleroften i would have to clean the inside of the ovensi would have to empty broken glass recycling which was dangerous and unpleasantpretty much any kind of weird unpleasant tasks that you can think of i generally had to do it cleaning the bathrooms after the dance nights and uhi usually just tried to put a smile on my face and pretend that it was just a part of the job and that everyone had to do their unshared their share of unpleasant tasks i would try not to make any big deal about it and i knew that i was getting paid so at that point it was just a matter if i wanted to get upset or not i usually don’t like to get upset because you don’t really get anywhere complaining about the stuff that you have to do if something needs to be done pleasant or unpleasant it was my jobi was getting paid my boss is understood that i was the lowest person of power so it’s easy to delegate me those tasks i would normally just accept those tasks and work efficiently and fast to get them done and go back to my normal job  and that’s how i did it
um this questions is really hard because i’m pretty weak and uh you know i just kinda want to go along with whatever everyone else in the group wants to do in my personal life you know if i suggest an idea and people don’t want to do it it doesn’t really bother me all that muchi’m okay with just doing whateverreally laid back like thatum you know and even in work situations i do just kinda go along with itbut there was at a time um at a different restaurant i worked at the whole culture of place was really openthey were always looking for suggestions on how to improve the placeso i felt really comfortable um you know bringing in new ideas and stuff like thatand so you know it was just a simple matter of going to my boss and being like well i think this would be a good ideai know you know with my past experiences in restaurants that this worked out really well for them or you know like adding a scoop of avocado to a sandwich i knew from my previous experience at a sandwich shop that people would pay like  1 25 for that so i just told him that like yeah people would totally pay  1 for thatthey made a lot of money on it and you know it was generally accepted so i never i don’t really have an experience kinda like persuade someone who is kinda on the fence with whatever idea i might have because i don’t know i never really felt the need to convince someone that they should come over to my side of whatever proposal or idea i might have so the outcome is usually yay or neigh but i don’t try very hard to uh swing it in my favor i guess you could say
so i have a a recent situation in which i was not formal leader but tried to assume a leadership rolethe situation was a team meeting regarding a student where i work at a school and the meeting was really out of control even before it began we had one very dominant team member who started the meeting other folks were not there never introduced herself so i tried to intervene but i am not in the leadership role to do that by saying why don’t we uh introduce ourselves and try to model maybe more appropriate communication and that was not very effective when the principal came in who really needed to be in charge i caught her eye and said here’s where we are here’s what we are doing i think we may need to do a b and c to uh to you know proceed with the meeting and she did pick up on my cue uh but even so the meeting was still uh not very effectiveand um i i was able to meet with the parent that was at the meeting and make sure i took some notes i handed her the notes i met with her afterwards made sure she had contact info and then i did follow up with the principal and we put our heads together avoiding this type of situations again
recently i was in a situation where i had to explain our fundraising record keeping and data entry and reporting to someone outside of our organization um my foundation won a consultation with a woman who does um she does consulting with non profits and foundation to help them with various thingsso part of this consultation was that i had to walk the woman through our database and tell her what our current capabilities were and her goal was to tell us how to improve on themso before she can do that she needs to have a full and complete understanding of our data base and how it works and how we put data in and how we put data outi’ve never really had to explain that in full detail to anyone before because i’m the only person who uses it number 1 and because no one ever needed or cared to knowso how i did it was just began and the beginningwe used a screen share and i showed her on my screen everything from login in to to creating a profile to basically my process when someone gives us a contribution and my proves when i need to pull a report so instead of trying to explain everything to her or send her a summary of how it works we walked through it step by step and i showed visuallyi’m a visual learner and i find that i am also a visual explainerits easier for me to show you how to do something then it is for me to explain how to do something um and it worked for her as wellluckily that’s a good way for her to consume information
um i had to work with somebody who was um a person that she had a lot of personal issues that caused her to not be very effective with her job she would miss a lot of workshe had a lot of trouble concentratingshe was not at workum she had a lot of difficulty getting work that was assigned to her done and as a result of that myself and another person on the team ended up having to pickup a lot of her workand um after a while of course it became very frustrating to feel like you’ve got to carry more than your share of the load because somebody else is having problems uh personal problems outside of work that is effecting their ability to do their jobum i i worked with the situation for as long as i could after a while did say something to my bossi exposed concerns about the fact that this person had a myriad of personal issues that were distracting from their ability to do their job and how it was effecting me and ultimately how it was effecting just by the rest of the problems just like trickling downwardand um the issue was actually addressed repeatedly but it was never addressed effectivelyum the person continued to be a problemand um eventually the way the issue was resolved was the person ended up quitting their job because they simply couldn’t deal with the fact that the expectation were that they would carry their fair share of the workload again they felt too overwhelmed with their personal problems to be effective
um one of the times when i was actually i wasn’t a formal leader but i kinda took over a leadership was actually when we were when i was in college and we had a group project at the end of the year and um me and three other guys were actually together working on this projectand the leader was actually uh one of these guys we all elected and we would you know keep in touch with everyone and you know we didn’t really know each other that well and we found out later that he didn’t really do a very good job of that so i ended up taking on a lot of the responsibilitiesand i was actually able to get the group in touch with some people to actually help us with our project i actually used my workplace at the time to further the project along and we actually ended up doing the project on my work place so that was actually part of our senior project that we had to do so he was obviously part of our group um but we realized that he didn’t quite have the leadership abilities and leadership qualities that we thought he didespecially when it came to being prompt and on time you know to all of our get togetheri just kinda took over and never had the formal formal title of leader of the groupbut it just kinda happened during that time
i worked at another job where i was a security guard and uh who i worked with were people it was it was kinda weird because the people i worked with were who the people were they all had uh big egos and they weren’t even getting paid that much money it’s just that they had really big egos everyoneand i was kinda the new comer the low man on the totem poleso when i came in everyone was very aggressive and domineering and very self confidentand i uh i wouldn’t say aggressive really maybe that’s a bad word um yeahthey were just very assertive very confident and very they had very large egos and big personalities and i had to for probably six months had to kind of establish myself and just listen try to understand you know just try to i wouldn’t call it a coping its more of um like respect their position respect their position kind of facilitate a little bit and also esta yeah establish myself and like i said with the really dominant there were a couple domineering people like this guy named dave he was very domineering and i kind of just tried to listen to him a lotand there was this other guy named ben who i worked with for a long long time in the morning like the am shift and he was quitting smoking at one point like cold turkey quitting smoking and he was really really like a screw looseand he was really hard to work with for like five months and then it was like he opened up to me because i kept listening and kept understanding and things got better
okay so this is questions four and its please tell us about a time that you tried to gain trust of other you’re working with while trying to negotiate with themuh one of the jobs that i had was fourth and fifth grade teacherand i taught fourth and fifth grade at the same time and so one of the mains kills that you have to have as a teacher is being able to gain the trust of your students and so i’ve especially in the begging of the year it’s really difficult to get students to trust you because they don’t know you don’t know what type of person you areso one of the things uh that needs to be done is that students have to understand the rules of the classroom and rules of engagementso what i would do with the students in the beginning of the year is i would basically negotiate with them about um the rules in the classroom um what was expected of them what was not expected of themthe things they were supposed to do the things they could and could not do and the rule that were in the classroom and the rules that were in the schooland i think by doing that especially early on in the school year you gain a certain amount of trust from the studentsi don’t think that uh it was really a negotiation like they had a say in the rules and then i would bend my positionit was more like i was trying to negotiate with them in the sense that um i was trying to let them know the expectations beforehand and let them know what the consequences of the expectations would beso so i think by doing that i gained quite a bit of trust from the students
okay so i mentioned in one of my previous questions that i direct community outreach hours at my workplace which involves assigning people volunteer to do different events different programs out in the community and they they’re required to do community service for their jobone situation situation occurred when i had two particular ladies on the team when i first started and i did not know hated each otherone is supper fun and friendly and bubbly and everybody likes her and one nobody really likes because she is always getting other people in trouble and trying to sabotage their jobs and what they’re doingand i didn’t realize this tension was there to begin with so when they started not working well together and purposefully arguing over those petty things it wasn’t until someone told me you know they have this history of not getting along that she had gotten her in trouble um the less friendly of the two had gotten the more friendly one in trouble on more than one occasion she tattles on her all the time i’m pretty sure for example she tattled on her the other day for having capris on which she was allowed to wear that was almost to her knees which is against the rules anyways it’s just little things like that you know so to handle the situation that time i think there were two totally different pathslesson there interaction with each other i had to kind of take over a leadership role and just find a way for them not to work together and in the future do not assign them to groups togetherif there is an event they both want to do i tell one of them you know hey she’s working this one you’ll have the next one and i’ll just alternate them so they don’t have to interactand it worked
so back in my old job i worked at a pharmacy umone of the one of the things that we had to do as the pharmacy technician was to look through a book of all of the all of the prescriptions that we have we have in the um in the pending you know where guests haven’t picked up their prescriptions yet but we do have it waiting at the pharmacyso our our our goal with that is to call those guests and let them know that there is aperscription thereusually there is 150 200 guests and you have to leave at least a one minute message in order for it to be accept it otherwise they will not allow itso you have to sit there and you have to talk and describe exactly what you are doing but you have to also make sure you are not breaking hippa laws so you cannot disclose anything about their name or anything in the messageso generally they would make me do this and it would take me at least 4 5 hours to finish all of thati never was able to finish it faster and every time that i came in i was the one who was assigned to do that jobuh so i eventually told my boss that i did not want to be the one to always do this that’s someone else should be at least sharing this with meyou know at least taking half and ill take the other halfand she she complied and said that it was that was good she just thought that i enjoyed doing it when in reality i didn’t i just that i was the one who didn’t really say anything about it and complain right awayso um like i said eventually that task was split up among the technicians and i no longer had sole duty of doing all of that calling and leaving messages and talking to guests and so it actually ended up working out pretty well
ok so a time where i had to persuade a person or a group of people to except a proposal of my ideaand how to go about doing thisagain i was working in a bar and the bar was inside this huge restaurant that always had a big wait on the weekendsand i would always get upset because i thought that we would make more money in the bar then we were makingso i had my ideas to do some new things which were i guess not a a good thing around there to do something new and excitingum but i just thought that we got a new manager and i went to talk to that manager because the old managers never listensand i told him i had an idea i just get a our little chalkboard right on with colored chalk we never even did that beforeyou know like a margarita this muchyou know just a put there in the bar just something like that we never did thatto have make up some specials especially drinks there was a special of the nightyou know we never did that beforeand also to provide two appetizers in the bar because we do not offer foodbut just to i think we ended up doing like four appetizers which went over so welland i ended up getting two black chalk signs with the neon chalk to write onand had specialty drinks every nightyou know we just made up for drinks we were like oh this is some specialty margarita whateverwhich we had a we had that every nightbut having it on the board like that making it a a special and then having the for appetizerswhich was you know clean and new for us to get from the kitchen to get thereit wasn t hard to serve in the bar it didn t take up too much roomit was just for small appetizers that came on platesand we ended up making more money i mean because our tickets were higherthat s all i was trying to dowas to make people happier in the bar and bigger tipsand more money for the restaurant more money for meand the outcome was really great actually once i got the managers approval
my wife isn t the most technically minded individualand there is a lot of time that i totally forget that because we are the same age and being of a same generationi am 75 years oldwhen i was a child like a very very young child my dad was totally into video games he was a product of the 70s like he was space invaders asteroids junkieso of course when i was old enough to hold the controller in my hand you know i had that going onbut those who were only computerswe had pcs growing up that i watch blossom green screen ibm s and square a little apple computers up to the current generationtechnology that we have now and ithere is a lot of kids out there that they understand all these things are cool and they take them for grantedthey do not understand how a lot of things workit s fundamental some of the things but i am beating around the bushso sometimes unfortunately i leave my wife to do a task on the computer or something that s i would think that it is very easyand she was crying the other night because she was trying to do something online and she was just not getting it and it was frustrating the hell out of herand i just had to show her how to do it step by stepbut she got itshe s a quick study but she just does not sit down in front of the computer enough to really soak up most of the thingsa lot of things that i do in front of her i think she s taking in and grasping but she is just looking to be around mewhich we got a good you just have to do it little by little she s had to call me finei love her
um for my senior year at this college i’ve been conduction and ecological research study about a section of forest the college owns composition hat types of trees there are and when i was explaining what my ideas were for the project worked of my advisers it became clear to me at one point that there was kind of a disconnect between them and i about certain aspects of the project how i was going to lay out a survey area and i was trying to explain myself more and talk more but it didn t really help that much and i just kind of clicked that i should not talk as much and ask them what they thinki need just asked them what they think i need and i i listen to them and heard what they meant and then i you know compared to what i heard him say and what i now understand how he understands the situation to how i was and just kind of address that differenceit cleared it right up immediatelyand we were both on the same pagelately that s been happening again so i need to do it againbut i think that worked out pretty wellfor clearing that up that s just asking them what they think i needand then rectify that afterwardas opposed to just talking anymore about what i needotherwise i mean nothing else comes to mind of using listening to solve a problembut i am very proud of that little bit so20 seconds lefti like kuhi
