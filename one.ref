i do volunteer work as a member of the has gone mobile go i medical unit out what we do is we go out we set up with the tent and i were water who provide free drinks sunscreen bugs prints off to people who are out playing the game that way we can keep people safe keeping well hydrated only we have the any first aid kit with us as well arm but every day i'm in when i'm out there i'm interacting even though i'm in her acting as a character in the game on what the people i am interacting with them chinese solicit donations and stuff to keep the unit going and today many to arlo organization i personally work with sheets for kids when i set up the but it arm but while i'm working and i'm trying to help them stay hydrated help them with the game and everything masa translucent there's their nations because where not only are we trying to stay afloat and stay actor for them but we're also trying to get back to the community through the sheets for kids program i one specific time was i have i mean i because players terms joy which is one of the medical units and ours bandaging a child's ny i was half in and explain exactly who we are inside to parents while telling them owned anything beyond what we get is that she's for kids very it does help us stay afloat by purchasing water the band aids and sons mostly i just about having a smile on my face and being honest with the because if you're a good charity
i would like to purchase question from the perspective of a past job working fast food at wendys restaurant actually and i would say you know look one of the closers most my time after interruption the kitchen clean and not which meant that i didn't spend a long time off from that time but there will be a couple are usually two or three sometimes for depending on that's it was a busy day on people not handling the rest the customers for the light drive thru dining room things like that there was robert people in particular that work there one of them was a manager we saw she was shift commanders not the store manager no one more so yeah cashier young girl was fifteen time that willow's link for names robert   mr dingell longer wall i'm not sure exactly all the issues were between them but they were both fairly young that again tonsils like and no they just clashed sure whose personality years it at some disagreement sometime they argue all the time   my primary action taken during those situations close to stay out of the way and saying catch up to my job look don't worry about breast i'm bernard there were few jobs were nearly came to it i actually had to step up to a month so you know what we're we're here for is getting paid   screwjob then mortar retailers are about each other millimeters sudden side now i don't know what it's all about that i did too tend to have a calming effect on their relationship at least most time but i did it so i counted as a win
so i was taking and i work for a company that sold pre painted parts for cars and i was taking thousands of listings that were on ebay and they needed to be part on the amazon and the download segment didn't work between the two sites and so what had to be done is each individual and heart had to be put into a spread sheet what price and item number and information and then sent over to amazon and so this had to be done fifty thousand times i'm it was incredibly tedious and boring and there were just a few of us that were doing it arm and i just had to take a lot of breaks i am i would work for half an hour and then i would go spend ten minutes doing something else for work as well but just something to break up the monotony of doing the same thing over and over and over again i'm also made gains in my mind like little incentive is when i got you this number i got to go get a coffee or just something to break up the monotony because doing the same thing over and over again and this lasted for weeks i'm doing this was mind numbing and it was easy to zone out and make mistakes and so i find that if i anything i just right tasks into smaller tasks and assign some sort of an incentive forgetting to bats earned and doing it correctly and some of the time it would be that the girls and i would you know go shopping at the end of the day if we had a certain benchmark and so i just did that for myself and i did it for my employees as well that we just set certain goals and if we had and then we aren't reports
this goes back to you well in school and a member of the group for one of my upper division classes our assignment was to build a design for a machine that everybody could agree on how to meet certain criteria and we were in a group of six everybody pretty much had their own ideas about how to go about it nobody wanted to negotiate if everybody thought or idea was fast we are not using three designs to look at more closely my design was one of those   as a result i try to build that mike he's the best i could i designed out powerpoint presentation with some basic math models of how the machinery itself with it together i did some solidworks basic modeling to show how the components works how the old machine locked and i did my best you highlight what he affects of machine how it would work how the thing with it together well i probably spent about three hours of my own time when i went to school putting everything together to get my own point across and when we had our meeting each because i'm scared of her actually presented longer than everybody else because i thought what's on effort into it i had the basic model thirty done power point presentation done and i'd even done some basic calculations to make sure bought my model even usable for that sign ultimately after we had our meeting everybody was pretty across work that i put into it and we ended up using my design which is great because after i had done the preliminary studies but we actually went a lot more in depth with that but what i had started and that being great what we ended up doing
again this is such a situation would have occurred at the term current college web where i was a financial aid assistant trying to explain to the students into their parents how to fill the financially documents out and what each line item meant   and a lot of times i would use examples of all of them have somebody else's documents or or make up mock i completed applications make up mock her it rhodia's applications and let them see this look and compare the two i ask them to bring in their tax returns and let me show them exactly i love the corresponding i'm line item numbers i use a lot of analogies anything that would say i'm to them this is real money even though you don't get the cash in your hand you're you're getting money such as the earned income credit a lot of people did not understand that response that a particular answer at all   i just took time patience i'm to just go over it with each individual person and many times in a whole group and answer the questions this best i could nfi saw that there was a pattern to the questions i came up with a complete portion of my explanation to address that that pattern alone it let me know what they needed explained better than what i was doing and so i would i would take from that sent from that session you come back in and come up with a better explanation and better way of teaching and now i think i think it was quite successful we get a lot of success
mind you won't the moon bracket sprawl believe not the do occur project with robert classmate from mine or class no one really likes him i mean now i'm eating personally against him yeah he just are you kind of force like here rule moncler go it we like to say he will let go use exactly like this and never take so much longer now i am in a pretty much doing rumsfeld's house by myself miners so group projects and on time snake i mean you wasn't the underworld but it it wasn't a good experience you there they scarcely moon moon moves the highest that the products myself it's millions like here you down don't work me again i am sure i mean nor violent or shelter but the cells like yeah i can do wished it no john and maybes you would be more willing to like you were realistic is to work but it and if this is so much are you guessing nationally first timer to run out
there is one reason well murray subordinates colton smith case any plans to the rest our attitude when in reality is just over so he was standing post at a guard   carter i can choke point so people come in you stand there and recently there but a lot don't we show current rules here things like you know keep your work area free of all water no no no drinks no food stay standing all of her show setting some what do you do what about war specifically to drink or that apply to different areas but not as well lucky you standing there and it was nice to open doors you get the idea you know that and then one of the other supervisors will call them step towards you did not know that so the staff sergeant recording jane's james came by and started telling the you too that there was no order ceo setters are yeah we'll be orders grabbed the the binder what viewers with him so that was not the case i became kind of an argument and eventually i come in and if you the situation because he was trying to verbally abuse so where and it's actually sent you disrespect news anchors steps are harder and someone it should be doing that i know i know that when you're wrong doesn't matter what rank you are what are what position you hold an organization if you're wrong you're so raw no matter if the new guys telling you that
the situation took place very shortly after our move to a new facility   i currently hold the position of liaison of information technology within the hospital i manage all the computers and monitors and television equipment within the facility however this being a veterinary hospital   we do see a good number of patients dogs cats horses cows   exotic animals that type of thing i also happen to be a registered veterinary technician and during this one situation there was a shortage of nursing staff are the registered vat tax on the floor and we needed there were patients that needed to be treated there were patients that needed to have blood drawn and treatments done so using my my training as a registered pet tag i stepped in to help restrain and to help draw blood and i had to gain the trust of the doctors who did not know me as well as some of the other doctors in the facility i had to gain their trust and make sure that they understood that i do know how to do the skills i do know how to perform treatments how to restrain how to how to collect blood samples and whatnot so i hate basically spent twenty to thirty minutes just going through and demonstrating with them first hand exactly how the skills are to be performed before they basically were just willing to accept my help and once they accept that the outcome was very very positive everything got done that everyone got treated and everything came off without a hitch
yes so now the little bit more time to tell you about it and when you have been a member or senator missed an apple i asked them i care group out has now our manager i will have she would give was you know sir give us instructions on duty as a habit you at swansea excellency so we're doing and they will come back so whatever members in the group is not a member its members and the manager so she'd probably work well what can i was okay you chose to i cm market no that's not what i so we had soon laemmle sound right now what was being said an identical room debt even did make a difference so highlander situation i'm moving at this time brian i'm running it is not right chest and arms either way i gotta do the best i can do for me house ali i know and he you know that my modus not your motives are in the right racing marking down on america's you and your when you will win in this arm how was it you may have the carrot out it was on exam one abba stress when i hope work or stress i mean we've had people who had a grant yeah you go see it additional assistance you know why now set and make sure it wasn't really looking at people who have not because you just you just couldn't get anything you certainly this s. took my one arm under well how am i doing well wham i don't know i wasn't alone this time was it when it wasn't well series ago was around this time when it wasn't wrong you now have a yes show us your map there aren't embarrassed within yourself and you gotta be you gotta know what you do center where you wanna do guess question you can start right in iraq it's not me instance is just not me
well as far as unpleasant task go i would have to say that's usually just part of any job unless that you course work for yourself and even then there's unpleasant tasks   that my very first dishwashing job when i worked at a big   fast this restaurant i usually got the short end of the stick i could say that i probably got more unpleasant task than anybody and   i don't really try to argue or become defensive about it i would normally just you know chuck well little bit and then get on with the task of some of the tests ranged from in cleaning frozen ice off of the pipes in the downstairs me cooler   off then i would have to clean the inside of the high winds i would have to   in the broken glass recycling which was dangerous and unpleasant i arm pretty much any kind of weird unpleasant tasks that you can think of i generally had to do it right cleaning the bathrooms after the dance nights and   i usually would try to just put a smile on my face and pretend that it was just a part of the job and that   everybody had to do there i'm sure other share of our unpleasant past i would try not to make   any big deal about it and i knew that i was getting paid so at that point i was just a matter of if i wanted to get upset or not i usually don't like to get upset because you don't really get anywhere planning about the things that you have to do if something needs to be done pleasant or unpleasant it was my job i was getting paid my bosses understood that i was the lowest person of power so it's easy to dial game in this task i would normally just   except the tires and work officially and fast to get them done and go back to my normal job that's how i did it
this pressure is really hard because i'm pretty new and   nuns come on go along with whatever everybody else my response you   in my personal life you know if i see just ninety and people want to hear it doesn't really bother me very much i'm i'm here with his doing whatever no way back like that not   you know and even at work situations and you just kind of go along with that but there was a time   at a different restaurant i worked that out mobile cold here and the place was really open we're always looking for suggestions on how to improve the place so i felt really comfortable you know bringing in new ideas stuff like that and so he knows is the simple matter going to my boss like well you know i think this would be a good idea i know in you know with my past experiences knobs that this worked out really well for them or you know like our guests bob cargo to samplers i knew from a previous experiences out shop would pay like a dollar twenty five that so i just told him like yeah people would totally pay a dollar that they made a lot of money and he knows yeah early accepted so i never really had the experience i'm like sweet someone is kind of on the fence about whatever right here at my house because on our december really felt the need to convince someone that they said come over to my side and whatever proposal where idea i have so the outcome is usually wearing a brown hard very hard you and swing it in my favor he gets a
so i have learned a recent situation in which i was not the formal leader but try to assume a leadership role the situation was a team meeting i regarding a student out where i work in a school and after meeting was really out of control even before it began we had one very dominant team member who started the meeting other folks were not there never introduced herself home so i try to intervene up but i am not in a leadership role to two dots by saying you know why don't we harm introduce ourselves send i try to model may be more appropriate communication and that was not very effective when the operative okay men who really need it to be in charge i caught her eye and said here's where we are here's what we're doing i think we might need to i do eight pnc are to to our you know proceed with the meeting and she did pick up on my queue alan but even so z. meeting still what's our not very effective and   i i was able to ha neat with c. the parent that was at the meeting ha and make sure that she i took some notes i handed her the notes i arm that was our afterwards to make sure she and my contact info and then i just follow up with the principal and how we put our heads together about avoiding eye this kind of situation i can
later on ernie working which rationing rare i have to explain our i'm greening record keeping and she and her according to someone outside of our organization armonk herniation want me translocation are worrying new guy i am yes consulting with nonprofit foundations and repairing so heartedness consultation with that i have to walk the warning real our enemy and tell her what our current king buildings are in terrible how are how we can improve on them so before she can do that you are harmony for me and my name as i need me and hardware and how it but in the end and hurt me need our i never really had to explain and pulled the aircraft anywhere army and you know if you're using that number one any kind number now area very near now so i get it when it began at the beginning irony i will need to screen chair and i showed her armani gain everything hurt robin tank creating a profile at you basically my process when someone gives us a contribution are not crossed that lenny pulling report i understand it trying to explain everything your hair or send her some ran out where we watched there it that by that and i showed her vigil iron visual learner and i find that i'm mark sooner when your brain areas your journal to show you hardworking something managerial you explain how that you our aunt worked for her aunt lala green that and it makes perfect
whom i know to work with somebody who was a a person that she had a lot of personal issues the costs are not to be very effective return on she would miss a water works you have a water concentrating and serious about were   she had a lot of difficulty   getting work that was assigned her dawn and our missiles also that myself and another person on fuel without having to pick up a lot of for world and   after wild close it became very frustrating alex if you like you know you have a theory more than your share of the load because somebody else is having problems our own personal problems outside of work they're affecting their ability to do their job   i i'm bored with the situation from harm's i could   after awhile i did say something to my boss experts the sometimes about the fact that this person had a myriad of personal issues that were distracting from our ability to do their job and how that was affecting me yeltsin more houses affect the rest of the team despite the problems found trickling down were in some you sue was actually breast repeatedly but it was never a droughts the fact our own person continued to be a problem and   events we will waive the issue was resolved let's the person in the waiting room job because they simply couldn't deal with the fact that the expectations were that they were carrying their share of the work again we felt so overwhelmed with their personal problems to be back
on one of the times that i was actually out was not formally   but i can't accept over leadership on this actually when we were i was in college and we had a group project at the at the other year and i'll ask me and three other guys were actually together working on this project and around the leader was actually are one of the guys that some delegate the he would kind of you know keep in touch with everyone and everything we can really know each other that well and we found out later that i'm you know it's very good job at that and signed up taking over a lot of responsibilities how you know and i actually was able to gets the group in touch with some people to actually help us with our project tom actually use my workplace i'm at the time that day for the project along arm and mixing it up doing a project for my what i saw on that was actually part of our senior project on itself he he was stopped as a part of our group envelope realize that he couldn't quite happy leadership abilities always that we fight it especially when it came to been crompton all times are in all markets gathers and things like that so i just kind of took over never really had the form for a formal title of leader of the group but it just kinda happened
where data another job where i was a security guard and not who i worked with were people if so it was kind of weird because who would who the people are now half ralea   big egos yeah they weren't even getting paid that much money as they have really big everyone on this panel like the newcomer on the low man on the totem pole so when i came and everybody was very aggressive and very domineering and very   self confident that i want to take   aggressive really maybe that's been murdered i'm now they're just very assertive very confident and very they have very large he goes personalities and i had to for probably six months panama establish myself and just listen try to understand are and not just china i wouldn't call it a coping it was more like respect their position specter position kind of facilitate a little bit and also by state yeah establish myself and mike it's a book that really count there's a couple domineering people like this guy named dave it is very domineering and i and i just try to listen to all my life and then there was another guy named than that i work with for a long long time in the morning like i am sure and he was quitting smoking at one point like cold turkey quitting smoking in them really real and light and a screw loose and now he was really hard to work with for like five months and then and then it was like he opened up to me because i because i kept listening and understanding getting opened up and things got better right
okay so this is question for in its please tell us about a time where you try to gain the trust of others you're working with while trying to negotiate with them   one of jobs i've had was fourth and fifth grade teacher and i taught fourth and fifth grade at the same time and so one of the main skills that you have to have as a teacher is being able to gain the trust of your students and so i've especially in the beginning of the year it's really difficult to get students to trust you because they don't know you they don't know what kind of person you are so one of the things are that needs to be done is students have to understand the rules of the classroom and the rules of engagement so what i would do with the students in the beginning of the year as i would basically negotiate with them about arm the rules in the classroom arm what was expected of them book wasn't expected of them the things they were supposed to do with the things they could and could not do and the rules that were in the classroom and the rules that were in the school and i think by doing that i especially early on in the school year you gain a certain amount of trust from the students i don't think that our it was really a negotiation like they have a say in the rules and then i would spend my position there is more like i was trying and negotiate with them in the sense that arm i was trying to let them know the expectations beforehand and let them know what the consequences of the expectations would be so so i think by doing that i gained quite a bit of trust from this to

see the back of my old job i worked at a pharmacy owned one of the one of the things that we had to do as the pharmacy technician was to look through a book of all of the all of the prescriptions that we have in the house in the pending you know work as having picked up the prescription yet but we do have it waiting at the pharmacy so our our our goal with that is to call those gas and let them know that there is a prescription there usually is about a hundred and fifty to two hundred guests and you have to leave at least the one minute message in order for it to be accepted otherwise they will not allow it so it you have to sit there and you have to talk can describe exactly what you are doing but you have to also make sure that you're not breaking hippo laws you can't disclose any information about the name or anything in the message so generally they would make me do this and this would take me at least four to five hours to finish all of that i never was able to finish it faster and every time that i came in i was the one who was assigned to that job so i eventually told my boss that i did not want to be the one to always do this that someone else should be should be sharing this with me you know at least maybe taking half and i'll take the other house and she she complied and said that it was that was good she just thought that i enjoy doing it when in reality i didn't it's just that i was the one who didn't really say anything about it and complain right away so i'm like i said eventually that task was put up among the technicians and i no longer had the sole duty of doing all of that calling and leaving messages and talking to guess and so on it actually ended up working out pretty well
okay so i time i persuade a person or group of people to accept the proposal of my idea i had to go about doing this i'm again i'm off work in a bar and this bar was inside of our shoes restaurant that was held on big way low begins and how does get upset because our but we can make more money in the market we were making i'm so had i'm so ideas to do some new things which was it's not a good thing around there stew something new signing i'm that i just told you that we actually got a new manager and i would talk that manager because the other measures that will listen that's all i have no idea just like to get a little bored to write on with colored chalk and stuff like specials we never even did that before you know like a margarita for this my chin you know just so now to get there in the bar to something like that we never did that to have i make it's especially drinks like that was a special night you know arm will never did that before and i'm also into provide like some few appetizers the markets we didn't offer food but just so i think we end up doing what for appetizers which went over so well am i not get into black chalk science with neon or chopped right on and had specially drinks every night and you know we just made up the bricks of the like a home knows some special peach margarita whatever which we had it we have that every night i have here on a board like that make it like it was a special and and habbaniya for appetizers which was you know clean it was easy for us to get it from the kitchen to get there it was hard to serve in that in the bar into to much room just for small appetizers became a plate and and we end up making more money in because our tickets for hire knots that's almost one a jew and make people happier in the barn bigger tips and more money for russia more money for me and so the outcome was really great actually once i got the medical
my wife's isn't the most are technically minded individual and there's a lot of times they i totally forget act because we're the same age and being of the same generation i'm thirty five years ob when i was a child like they're very young child my dad was totally into but you use a product sept psyche risks space invaders asteroids junkie so course when i reach what's holding stronger you know i have been going on but those were only computers all we had pc was brought out that i watch the blossom reads great ibm's sh and square little apple computers in the current generation technology that we have now can i do there's a lot of kids out there that they understand all these things are cool and we take it for granted that there are still a lot of things work just it's fundamental something but i am beating rob i so sometimes unfortunately i lead my wife to do a task cuter or something that's are very i would think it's very easy and i she was crying the other week because she was trying to do something line and she was just not getting it it was frustrating the hell out of her and i just had to either short how did you just to step a step and she nodded jeans she looked quick study but she just does not sit well ordered from of the computer enough's i sure will e. soak up most of them are things that i do it forever i think she's taking in grasping but she's she's just like you dear so was it we got it done we just had to do a little by little shoes acted well i'll i look
  for my senior year at this college i've been conducting a ecological research study about a section of forest the college owns a composition of the trees in the forest what types of trees there are and when i was explaining what my ideas for the project were to my advisors are it became clear to me at one point that there is kind of a disconnect between them and i about a certain aspect of the project house going to lay out a survey area   and i was trying to explain myself more and talk more but didn't really help that much and i just kinda clicked that i should not talk as much and and you ask them what they think i mean just ask them what they think i mean and i i listened to him i heard what he meant none i you know compared what i heard him say what i now understand how he understands the situation to how i was and just kind of addressed that difference are they cleared it right up immediately   and we're both on the same page lately it's been happening again so i need to do it again but i i think that worked out pretty well for clearing that up is just asking them what they think ibm and then we rectify that afterwards as opposed to just talking more about what i need otherwise to me nothing else comes to mind of using listening to solve a problem but i am very proud all of that little bit there it's left and like you i
