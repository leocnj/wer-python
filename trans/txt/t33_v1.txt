Umm if I had to work with someone I didn’t really like or get along with
The way I would interact with this person is mostly to keep it on a superficial work level 
Similar to like how during the two thousands the Lakers with Kobe and Shaq.
They’ve constantly talked about how their relationship was purely work and I feel like I would take a similar approach 
I I have actually taken a similar approach with one of my superiors who was not very kind 
So I didn’t really want to interact that much outside of work 
And when I had more of my share of unpleasant tasks
The way I did it was usually just suck it up and do em if they’re easy  
But if it’s a little harder and its stuff I don’t really want to do then I’ll talk to my supervisor about it and try to get that reduced 
That’s the way I do it
And that’s it
