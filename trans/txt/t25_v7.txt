This goes back to when I was in school and a member of the group who were one of my upper division classes I meant was to build a design for a machine that everyone could agree on 
It had to meet certain criteria and we were in a group of six
Everybody pretty much had their own ideas about how to go about it
Nobody wanted to negotiate because everybody thought their idea was the best 
We ended up choosing three designs to look at more closely 
My design was one of those
As a result I tried to build up my case the best way I could 
I designed a PowerPoint presentation with some basic math models of how the machinery itself would fit together 
I did some solid works basically modeling to show how the components looked how the ultimate machine looked and I did my best to highlight the key aspects of the machine 
How it would work how everything would fit together well 
I probably spend about three hours of my own time outside of school putting everything together to get my own point across 
And when we had our meeting we each presented 
I actually presented longer than everyone else because I put more thought and effort into it  
I had the basic models already done I had PowerPoint presentation done and I had even done some basic calculations to make sure that my model was even feasible for the design 
Ultimately after we had our meeting everyone was pretty impressed with the work I had put into it and we ended up choosing my design 
Which was great because after I had done the preliminary studies we actually went a lot more in depth with it but what I had started ended up being great for what we ended up doing.
