So I was taking I worked for a company that sold pre-painted parts for cars 
And I was taking thousands of listings that were on eBay and they needed to be put onto Amazon and the download segment didn’t work between the two sites 
So what had to be done was each individual part had to be put into a spreadsheet with price and item number and information and then sent over to amazon 
And so this had to be done 50,000 times 
It was incredibly tedious and boring and there were just a few of us that were doing it 
And I just had to take a lot of breaks
I would work for half an hour and then I would go spend 10 minutes doing something else for work as well
But just something to break up the monotony of doing the same thing over and over and over again 
I also made games in my mind like little incentives
When I got to this number I got to go get a coffee or just something to break up the monotony because doing the same thing over and over again and this lasted for weeks of doing this was mind numbing and it was easy to zone out and make mistakes  
And so I find that if I anything if just break tasks up into smaller tasks and assign some sort of an incentive for getting to that and doing it correctly and some of the time it would be the girls that I would you know go shopping at the end of the day if we hit a certain benchmark 
So I just did that for myself and I did it for my employees as well 
That was just set certain goals and if we hit them we earned rewards
