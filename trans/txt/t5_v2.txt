So I have a a recent situation in which I was not formal leader but tried to assume a leadership role
The situation was a team meeting regarding a student where I work at a school and the meeting was really out of control 
Even before it began we had one very dominant team member who started the meeting other folks were not there never introduced herself 
So I tried to intervene but I am not in the leadership role to do that by saying why don’t we uh introduce ourselves and try to model maybe more appropriate communication and that was not very effective 
When the Principal came in who really needed to be in charge I caught her eye and said here’s where we are here’s what we are doing 
I think we may need to do A B and C to uh to you know proceed with the meeting 
And she did pick up on my cue uh but even so the meeting was still uh not very effective
And um I I was able to meet with the parent that was at the meeting and make sure I took some notes 
I handed her the notes 
I met with her afterwards made sure she had contact info and then I did follow up with the principal and we put our heads together avoiding this type of situations again.
