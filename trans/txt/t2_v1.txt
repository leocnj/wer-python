Hi whelp take me back it’s probably not a do a good project with Robert his classmate from my network class 

No one really liked him I mean not having anything personally against him 

He just he kind of was like a rule mungler we like to say 

He would like oh you look exactly like this and it would take so much longer 

Yeah 

I ended up pretty much doing almost all the task by myself thats how group project end a lot of the time I think 

I mean wasn’t end of world but it wasn’t good experience either 

Just basically was eh I don’t know I just did the project myself basically 

Ian was like here yeah don’t work me again 

I’m sure I mean we weren’t violent towards each other but it was still was like eh 

Yeah I do wish that I don’t know maybe he would be more willing to like be more realistic because worth it

This is just always how group project are 

I’m guessing I should wait for the timer to run out.
