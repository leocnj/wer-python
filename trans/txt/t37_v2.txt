So for me this leads back to questions one of the individual that I didn’t get along with and because their lack of ability and trying to take credit for things 
So I put myself in the leadership of everyone underneath me and insured that they would always report to me anything that was going up higher 
That point in time I could leverage who it was told to whether it be leadership past my immediate supervisor work around other sections and basically showing I was in charge continuously the entire time
He was more of a figurehead 
And so the outcome was the other sections respected my work and what I did drastically more than what they were expected of his 
And like I said in questions one once myself and one or two other individuals left that area that he was leaning upon  he ended up getting fired and moving onto a position with less responsibility
And another individual who had replaced me ended up taking over for that section
