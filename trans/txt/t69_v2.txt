Um one of the times when I was actually I wasn’t a formal leader but I kinda took over a leadership was actually when we were when I was in college and we had a group project at the end of the year and um 
Me and three other guys were actually together working on this project
And the leader was actually uh one of these guys we all elected and we would you know keep in touch with everyone and you know we didn’t really know each other that well and we found out later that he didn’t really do a very good job of that so I ended up taking on a lot of the responsibilities
And I was actually able to get the group in touch with some people to actually help us with our project 
I actually used my workplace at the time to further the project along 
And we actually ended up doing the project on my work place 
So that was actually part of our senior project that we had to do so 
He was obviously part of our group um but we realized that he didn’t quite have the leadership abilities and leadership qualities that we thought he did
Especially when it came to being prompt and on time you know to all of our get together
I just kinda took over and never had the formal formal title of leader of the group
But it just kinda happened during that time.
