Um I had to work with somebody who was um a person that she had a lot of personal issues that caused her to not be very effective with her job 
She would miss a lot of work
She had a lot of trouble concentrating
She was not at work
Um she had a lot of difficulty getting work that was assigned to her done and as a result of that myself and another person on the team ended up having to pickup a lot of her work
And um after a while of course it became very frustrating to feel like you’ve got to carry more than your share of the load because somebody else is having problems uh personal problems outside of work that is effecting their ability to do their job
Um I I worked with the situation for as long as I could 
After a while did say something to my boss
I exposed concerns about the fact that this person had a myriad of personal issues that were distracting from their ability to do their job and how it was effecting me and ultimately how it was effecting just by the rest of the problems just like trickling downward
And um the issue was actually addressed repeatedly but it was never addressed effectively
Um the person continued to be a problem
And um eventually the way the issue was resolved was the person ended up quitting their job because they simply couldn’t deal with the fact that the expectation were that they would carry their fair share of the workload 
Again they felt too overwhelmed with their personal problems to be effective.
