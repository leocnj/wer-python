Again this situation would have occurred at the umm college of where I was a financial aid assistant 
Trying to explain to the students and to their parents how to fill the financial documents out and what each line item meant 
And a lot of times I would use examples of somebody else’s documents or make up mock completed applications make up mock erroneous applications and let them see this let them compare the two ask them bring in their tax returns and let me show them exactly uh the corresponding umm line item numbers 
I used a lot of analogies anything that would say um to them this is real money even though you don’t get the cash in your hand you’re getting money such as the earned income credit  
A lot of people did not understand that response that particular answer at all 
I just took time patience um to just go over it with each individual person and many times in a whole group and answered the questions as best I could 
And if I saw there was a pattern to the questions I came up with a complete portion of my explanation to address that pattern
It let me know what they needed explained better than what I was doing 
And so I would take from that example from that session and come back and come up with a better explanation and better way of teaching them that 
And I think I was quite successful
We had a lot of success.
