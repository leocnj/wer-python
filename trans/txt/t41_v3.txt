So this one was pretty recent 
One of my subordinates call him smith in this case 
He tends to be misconstrued as having attitude when in reality he’s just overly confident
So we he was standing post at a guard post we’ll just call it that control point so people come in and out 
He was standing there and recently there had been a lot of dog and pony show kind of rules here things like keep your work area clear of water bottles no drinks no food stay standing at all times if you’re on post because sitting down just looks unprofessional things like that 
The water bottle rule specifically the drink rule that applied to different area but not to his post because of the LINK how long he would be standing there and the fact that it was next to an open door so you can get dehydrated very easily
He knew that 
And then one of the other supervisors we will call them staff sergeants he did not know that
So this staff sergeant we will call him James
James came by and starting telling him that he needed to remove that and that was an order from CO etc. etc.
Smith who knew the orders who had the the binder with the orders with him told him that was not the case and it became kind of an argument
And eventually I had to come and diffuse the situation because he was trying to verbally abuse Smith and essentially say that he was disrespecting his rank as a staff sergeant supervisor and a subordinate shouldn’t be doing that
I had to let him know that when you are wrong it doesn’t matter what rank you are what position you hold in an organization 
If you’re wrong you are still wrong 
It doesn’t matter if the new guy is telling you that
