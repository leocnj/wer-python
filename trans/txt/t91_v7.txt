OK so a time where I had to persuade a person or a group of people to except a proposal of my idea
And how to go about doing this
Again I was working in a bar and the bar was inside this huge restaurant that always had a big wait on the weekends
And I would always get upset because I thought that we would make more money in the bar then we were making
So I had my ideas to do some new things which were I guess not a a good thing around there to do something new and exciting
Um but I just thought that we got a new manager and I went to talk to that manager because the old managers never listens
And I told him I had an idea i just get a our little chalkboard right on with colored chalk we never even did that before
You know like a margarita this much
You know just a put there in the bar just something like that we never did that
To have make up some specials especially drinks there was a special of the night
You know we never did that before
And also to provide two appetizers in the bar because we do not offer food
But just to I think we ended up doing like four appetizers which went over so well
And I ended up getting two black chalk signs with the neon chalk to write on
And had specialty drinks every night
You know we just made up for drinks we were like oh this is some specialty margarita whatever
Which we had a we had that every night
But having it on the board like that making it a a special and then having the for appetizers
Which was you know clean and new for us to get from the kitchen to get there
It wasn't hard to serve in the bar it didn't take up too much room
It was just for small appetizers that came on plates
And we ended up making more money I mean because our tickets were higher
That's all I was trying to do
Was to make people happier in the bar and bigger tips
And more money for the restaurant more money for me
And the outcome was really great actually once I got the managers approval.
