Recently I was in a situation where I had to explain our fundraising record keeping and data entry and reporting to someone outside of our organization 
Um my foundation won a consultation with a woman who does um she does consulting with non-profits and foundation to help them with various things
So part of this consultation was that I had to walk the woman through our database and tell her what our current capabilities were 
And her goal was to tell us how to improve on them
So before she can do that she needs to have a full and complete understanding of our data base and how it works and how we put data in and how we put data out
I’ve never really had to explain that in full detail to anyone before because I’m the only person who uses it number 1 and because no one ever needed or cared to know
So how I did it was just began and the beginning
We used a screen share and I showed her on my screen everything from login in to to creating a profile to basically my process when someone gives us a contribution and my proves when I need to pull a report 
So instead of trying to explain everything to her or send her a summary of how it works we walked through it step-by-step and I showed visually
I’m a visual learner and I find that I am also a visual explainer
Its easier for me to show you how to do something then it is for me to explain how to do something 
Um and it worked for her as well
Luckily that’s a good way for her to consume information
