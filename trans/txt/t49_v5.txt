So now there is a little bit more time to tell you about a time when a member of the group two members of the group did not work well together
Like I said in my current group I pass I’m manager 
I mean she would give us you know 
She would give us instructions on duties how to do X Y Z X Y Z
So well do it and then we’ll come back 
So we were talking about members of the group its not even members its members and the manager so she’s part of the group 
We would come back and say well you chose to do it like this  
Shed mark it up and say no that’s not what I told you to do 
So we’ve had to literally start right now what was being said 
And at that point even that didn’t make a difference
So how did I handle the situation 
I really had to stop running
I had to really just put my faith and trust in god and say you know what I gotta do the best I can do for me because I only I know and he know that my motives as long as you know that your motives are in the right place and as long you’re not doing out of malice you can you you will win in this situation
Um was the jappay (sp?) how was the current now (sp?)
It was a point in time where I was stressed when the whole group was stressed
I mean we’ve had people who’ve had to branch out and go to get additional assistance 
You know for their own stuff to make sure they wasn’t losing their mind really 
We’ve had people who have left the group because you just you just couldn’t get in cohesiveness as to okay what am I doing wrong how am I doing wrong why am I doing it wrong and whys it wrong this time when it wasn’t wrong two weeks ago
Why is it wrong this time when it wasn’t wrong you know the other day 
It’s just you have to find a balance within yourself and you gotta be you gotta know what you’re doing so when you’re when you do get questioned you can say you know what it’s not me
This is just not me.
