Um this questions is really hard because 
I’m pretty weak and uh you know I just kinda want to go along with whatever everyone else in the group wants to do 
In my personal life you know if I suggest an idea and people don’t want to do it it doesn’t really bother me all that much
I’m okay with just doing whatever
Really laid back like that
Um you know and even in work situations I do just kinda go along with it
But there was at a time um at a different restaurant I worked at 
The whole culture of place was really open
They were always looking for suggestions on how to improve the place
So I felt really comfortable um you know bringing in new ideas and stuff like that
And so you know it was just a simple matter of going to my boss and being like well I think this would be a good idea
I know you know with my past experiences in restaurants that this worked out really well for them or you know like adding a scoop of avocado to a sandwich I knew from my previous experience at a sandwich shop that people would pay like $1.25 for that 
So I just told him that like yeah people would totally pay $1 for that
They made a lot of money on it 
And you know it was generally accepted so 
I never I don’t really have an experience kinda like persuade someone who is kinda on the fence with whatever idea I might have because I don’t know I never really felt the need to convince someone that they should come over to my side of whatever proposal or idea I might have 
So the outcome is usually yay or neigh but I don’t try very hard to uh swing it in my favor I guess you could say
