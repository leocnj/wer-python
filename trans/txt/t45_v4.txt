This situation took place very shortly after our move to a new facility
I currently hold the position of liaison of information technology within the hospital 
I manage all the computers and monitors and television equipment within the facility 
However this being a veterinary hospital we do see a good number of patients dogs cats horses cows exotic animals that type of thing 
I also happen to be a registered veterinary technician and during this one situation there was a shortage of nursing staff of the registered vet techs on the floor and we needed 
There were patients that needed to be treated there were patients that needed to have blood drawn and treatments done so using my my training as a registered vet tech I stepped in to help restrain and help take blood and I had to gain the trust of the doctors who did not know me as well as some of the other doctors in the facility 
I had to gain their trust and make sure that they understood that I do know how to do these skills I do know how to perform treatments how to restrain how to how to collect blood samples and whatnot 
So I basically spent twenty to thirty minutes just going through and demonstrating with them firsthand exactly how these skills are to be performed before they were basically just willing to accept my help 
And once they accepted that the outcome was very very positive
Everything got done everyone got treated and everything came off without a hitch.
