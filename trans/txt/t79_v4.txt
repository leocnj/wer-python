Okay so this is questions four and its please tell us about a time that you tried to gain trust of other you’re working with while trying to negotiate with them
Uh one of the jobs that I had was fourth and fifth grade teacher
And I taught fourth and fifth grade at the same time 
And so one of the mains kills that you have to have as a teacher is being able to gain the trust of your students 
And so I’ve especially in the begging of the year it’s really difficult to get students to trust you because they don’t know you don’t know what type of person you are
So one of the things uh that needs to be done is that students have to understand the rules of the classroom and rules of engagement
So what I would do with the students in the beginning of the year is I would basically negotiate with them about um the rules in the classroom um what was expected of them what was not expected of them
The things they were supposed to do the things they could and could not do and the rule that were in the classroom and the rules that were in the school
And I think by doing that especially early on in the school year you gain a certain amount of trust from the students
I don’t think that uh it was really a negotiation like they had a say in the rules and then I would bend my position
It was more like I was trying to negotiate with them in the sense that um I was trying to let them know the expectations beforehand and let them know what the consequences of the expectations would be
So so I think by doing that I gained quite a bit of trust from the students
