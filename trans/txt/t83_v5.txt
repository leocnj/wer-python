Okay so I mentioned in one of my previous questions that I direct community outreach hours at my workplace which involves assigning people volunteer to do different events different programs out in the community 
And they they’re required to do community service for their job
One situation situation occurred when I had two particular ladies on the team when I first started and I did not know hated each other
One is supper fun and friendly and bubbly and everybody likes her and one nobody really likes because she is always getting other people in trouble and trying to sabotage their jobs and what they’re doing
And I didn’t realize this tension was there to begin with so when they started not working well together and purposefully arguing over those petty things it wasn’t until someone told me you know they have this history of not getting along that she had gotten her in trouble um the less friendly of the two had gotten the more friendly one in trouble on more than one occasion 
She tattles on her all the time I’m pretty sure for example she tattled on her the other day for having capris on which she was allowed to wear that was almost to her knees which is against the rules 
Anyways it’s just little things like that you know 
So to handle the situation that time I think there were two totally different paths
Lesson there interaction with each other I had to kind of take over a leadership role and just find a way for them not to work together and in the future do not assign them to groups together
If there is an event they both want to do I tell one of them you know hey she’s working this one you’ll have the next one and I’ll just alternate them so they don’t have to interact
And it worked
