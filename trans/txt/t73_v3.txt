I worked at another job where I was a security guard 
And uh who I worked with were people it was it was kinda weird because the people I worked with were who the people were they all had uh big egos 
And they weren’t even getting paid that much money it’s just that they had really big egos everyone
And I was kinda the new comer the low man on the totem pole
So when I came in everyone was very aggressive and domineering and very self-confident
And I uh I wouldn’t say aggressive really maybe that’s a bad word 
Um yeah
They were just very assertive very confident and very they had very large egos and big personalities 
And I had to for probably six months had to kind of establish myself and just listen try to understand 
You know just try to I wouldn’t call it a coping its more of um like respect their position 
Respect their position kind of facilitate a little bit and also esta yeah establish myself 
And like I said with the really dominant there were a couple domineering people like this guy named Dave he was very domineering and I kind of just tried to listen to him a lot
And there was this other guy named ben who I worked with for a long long time in the morning like the AM shift and he was quitting smoking at one point like cold turkey quitting smoking and he was really really like a screw loose
And he was really hard to work with for like five months 
And then it was like he opened up to me because I kept listening and kept understanding and things got better.
