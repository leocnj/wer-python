I’d like to approach this question from a perspective of a past job

I used to work at fast food at a Wendy’s restaurant actually and I was a one of the closers I spent most of my time after the dinner rush in the kitchen cleaning up

And which meant that I didn’t spend a lot time out front at that time but there would be a couple usually two or three sometimes four depending on the if it was a busy day people you know handling the rest of the customers for the night the drive through the dining room things like that

There was one pair of people in particular that were there

One of them was the manager Lisa she was a shift manager she was not the store manager and another one was a cashier a young girl was 15 at the time I believe her name was Robin

Those two didn’t get along very well at all

I’m not sure exactly the issues were between them but they were both fairly young and again at the time so was I and they just clashed I wasn’t sure if it was personality or they had had some disagreement at some time they argued all the time

My primary action taken during those situations was to stay out of the way and stay in the kitchen and do my job and let them worry about the rest

However there were a few times where it really came to a head and I actually had to step up to them and say you know what we are here for a reason we are getting paid to do a job and whatever your feelings are about each other you really need to set them aside

Now I don’t know what they thought about that but it did tend to have a calming effect on their relationship at least on the times that I did it so I counted it as a win
