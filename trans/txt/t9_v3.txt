Um for my senior year at this college I’ve been conduction and ecological research study about a section of forest the college owns composition hat types of trees there are 
And when I was explaining what my ideas were for the project worked of my advisers it became clear to me at one point that there was kind of a disconnect between them and I about certain aspects of the project 
How I was going to lay out a survey area and 
I was trying to explain myself more and talk more but it didn't really help that much and I just kind of clicked that I should not talk as much and ask them what they think
I need just asked them what they think I need and I I listen to them and heard what they meant 
And then I you know compared to what I heard him say and what I now understand how he understands the situation to how I was and just kind of address that difference
It cleared it right up immediately
And we were both on the same page
Lately that's been happening again so I need to do it again
But I think that worked out pretty well
For clearing that up that's just asking them what they think I need
And then rectify that afterward
As opposed to just talking anymore about what I need
Otherwise I mean nothing else comes to mind of using listening to solve a problem
But I am very proud of that little bit so
