So back in my old job I worked at a pharmacy um
One of the one of the things that we had to do as the pharmacy technician was to look through a book of all of the all of the prescriptions that we have we have in the um in the pending 
You know where guests haven’t picked up their prescriptions yet but we do have it waiting at the pharmacy
So our our our goal with that is to call those guests and let them know that there is aperscription there
Usually there is 150-200 guests and you have to leave at least a one minute message in order for it to be accept it otherwise they will not allow it
So you have to sit there and you have to talk and describe exactly what you are doing but you have to also make sure you are not breaking HIPPA laws so you cannot disclose anything about their name or anything in the message
So generally they would make me do this and it would take me at least 4-5 hours to finish all of that
I never was able to finish it faster and every time that I came in I was the one who was assigned to do that job
Uh so I eventually told my boss that I did not want to be the one to always do this that’s someone else should be at least sharing this with me
You know at least taking half and ill take the other half
And she she complied and said that it was that was good she just thought that I enjoyed doing it when in reality I didn’t I just that I was the one who didn’t really say anything about it and complain right away
So um like I said eventually that task was split up among the technicians and I no longer had sole duty of doing all of that calling and leaving messages and talking to guests and so it actually ended up working out pretty well.
