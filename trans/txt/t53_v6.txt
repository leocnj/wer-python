 Well as far as unpleasant tasks go I would have to say that’s usually just part of any job unless that you work for yourself and even then there are unpleasant tasks 
In my very first dish washing job when I worked at a big fast paced restaurant 
I usually got the short end of the stick 
I can say that I probably got more unpleasant tasks than anybody and um I didn’t really try to argue or become defensive about it 
I would normally just you know chuckle a little bit and then get one with the task 
Some of the tasks ranged from cleaning frozen ice off of the pipes in the downstairs meat cooler
Often I would have to clean the inside of the ovens
I would have to empty broken glass recycling which was dangerous and unpleasant
Pretty much any kind of weird unpleasant tasks that you can think of I generally had to do it 
Cleaning the bathrooms after the dance nights and uh
I usually just tried to put a smile on my face and pretend that it was just a part of the job and that everyone had to do their unshared their share of unpleasant tasks 
I would try not to make any big deal about it and I knew that I was getting paid so at that point it was just a matter if I wanted to get upset or not 
I usually don’t like to get upset because you don’t really get anywhere complaining about the stuff that you have to do 
If something needs to be done pleasant or unpleasant it was my job
I was getting paid 
My boss is understood that I was the lowest person of power so it’s easy to delegate me those tasks 
I would normally just accept those tasks and work efficiently and fast to get them done and go back to my normal job. 
And that’s how I did it.
