My wife isn't the most technically minded individual
And there is a lot of time that I totally forget that because we are the same age and being of a same generation
I am 75 years old
When I was a child like a very very young child my dad was totally into video games he was a product of the 70s like he was Space invaders asteroids junkie
So of course when I was old enough to hold the controller in my hand you know I had that going on
But those who were only computers
We had PCs growing up that I watch blossom green screen IBM's and square a little apple computers up to the current generation
Technology that we have now and I
There is a lot of kids out there that they understand all these things are cool and they take them for granted
They do not understand how a lot of things work
It's fundamental some of the things but I am beating around the bush
So sometimes unfortunately I leave my wife to do a task on the computer or something that's 
I would think that it is very easy
And she was crying the other night because she was trying to do something online and she was just not getting it and it was frustrating the hell out of her
And I just had to show her how to do it step-by-step
But she got it
She's a quick study but she just does not sit down in front of the computer enough to really soak up most of the things
A lot of things that I do in front of her I think she's taking in and grasping but she is just looking to be around me
Which we got a good you just have to do it little by little she's had to call me fine
I love her.
